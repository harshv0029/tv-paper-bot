# Strategy learnings (durable, one entry per strategy or idea discussed)

Rule (CLAUDE.md, 2026-10-11): every new strategy or idea we discuss gets an entry here in the same commit as its backlog row,
with the important items (and a closing "Profit-booking / exit takeaway" line): the mechanism, why it should or should not work in THIS system (NSE/MCX, Kotak, costs, FIFO, no
unstopped trades), what the backtest showed (tags, PFnet, n), what broke or surprised us, and what to reuse next time.

## Overnight anomaly (night vs day), video 2026-10-11, B-363/B-364
- Mechanism: buy close, sell next open (night); short open, cover close (day). Edge is real gross: night long about +0.17% per night on NIFTY 200.
- Lesson: a daily flip pays the round-trip cost every session; at 0.8% it erases any sub-0.5% edge. Check gross edge vs cost before building.
- Result: all four legs fail (PFnet 0.07 to 0.36); stopped day variants identical. Night legs cannot carry a firing stop (market closed).
- Reuse: any high-frequency or tiny-edge idea needs gross edge above about 1% per trade at this cost model.

## Microstructure / pro-rata market making, video 2026-10-11, B-365/B-366
- Mechanism: quote both sides, capture spread, pro-rata fills favour size (CME rate futures).
- Lesson: NSE/MCX are price-time (FIFO); no tick/L2/L3 history; unhedged inventory violates no-trade-without-SL.
- Reuse: order-book imbalance from Kotak depth is the one testable piece (B-366): record snapshots first, backtest later.

## MCX daily cells and the stop question, 2026-10-11, B-355/B-362
- Lesson: a backtest without a stop is not evidence for a stopped live trade. Of 27 no-stop PFnet>1 cells only 8 kept PFnet>=1.1 when ATR-stopped (1.5 and 2.5).
- Rule of thumb: wire a cell only if every stopped variant clears the floor, not just the headline one.

## Option strikes: indicator strategies, 2026-10-11, B-356/B-359
- Lesson: equity-daily PFnet does not transfer to option-premium candles; unmeasured means gated closed. Record shadow signals first, backtest on premium history, then wire.

## Viable floor 1.1, 2026-10-11, B-360
- Lesson: raising the floor from 1.0 to 1.1 closed 117 of 218 wired cells automatically; borderline cells (1.0 to 1.1) are noise-level after costs.

## Standing principle (user, 2026-10-11)
- The only aim of this bot is profit from every trade it takes. Use this file before every strategy, sizing, exit or profit-booking decision.

## Profit-booking / exit takeaways so far
- Overnight anomaly: a 1-bar hold has no room for 0.8% cost; prefer holds where average gross win per trade is several times the cost.
- MCX: exits must be the stop the backtest assumed; no-stop edges did not survive a 1.5 to 2.5 ATR stop for 19 of 27 cells.
- OB/VP history: edge sat on 30-day survivors while trail stops lost; wide stops plus long holds, not tight trails, carried those PFnets.
- Faster turnover is preferred only among equal-edge variants; cost per trade decides whether fast is viable at all.


## Supply & Demand Morning Star + Break of Structure (retest entry), video 2026-10-11, B-370
- Mechanism: downtrend (lower highs/lows) -> star at support -> bullish c3 -> close above last lower high (BOS) -> limit buy on the star-zone retest, SL below star low, TP at supply origin, min R:R 1.5 to 2. Short mirror = evening star + bearish BOS.
- Fit: it is a stopped, limit-entry, target-exit setup, so it satisfies no-trade-without-SL by design and has defined exits. Swing/day-trade candidate on stocks; options variant only after a premium backtest.
- Pattern is strict (few trades per symbol); needs the full universe for a usable n. Bars-based expiry (15 bars) and hold (30 bars) change meaning with candle size, so each size is its own result.
- Profit-booking / exit takeaway: target at structural origin with R:R floor is a defined profit-booking rule; compare its realised R against the trail-stop families when results land.

### Overnight anomaly, full-universe confirmation (2026-10-11)
- 2.4M trades per cell: best leg day short PFnet 0.582, night long 0.449 (avg net -0.41% per trade). The anomaly exists gross but the 0.8% cost is bigger than the whole edge on NSE.
- Profit-booking / exit takeaway: single-bar holds cannot be profit-booked after this cost; only multi-day holds with large average wins survive.

## RSI(10) pullback above SMA200 (daily), user video 2026-10-11
- Mechanism: buy an oversold dip (RSI10<30) only while price is above the 200-day SMA; exit on RSI recovery >40, 10-day time stop, stop under swing low. Classic short-horizon mean reversion (Connors-style).
- Fit here: swing-style and natively carries a stop (passes no-trade-without-SL). Concern: the 0.8% round trip is large against typical 2-4% mean-reversion bounces; a claimed 78% win rate says nothing about PFnet and omits costs. The video's backtest link was dead, so nothing is verified; we rebuilt it.
- Test: scripts/rsi_pullback_sma200.py, both directions, sweep entry/exit RSI and swing lookback. Results pending (B-372).
- Profit-booking / exit takeaway: pending results; an RSI-recovery exit books profit in about 3-5 bars if it works, so turnover is fast (good under the faster-capital rule).
